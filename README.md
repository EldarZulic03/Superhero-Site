# Superhero Data Web App

This project, completed as part of one of my software classes, focuses on designing and implementing a robust ReST API for accessing superhero data from movies, cartoons, and books. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a scalable and efficient solution for retrieving superhero information from provided JSON files.

## Features

- **ReST API Implementation:** Developed a feature-rich ReST API that allows users to retrieve information about superhero characters, their powers, and more.

- **User-Friendly Frontend:** Created an intuitive and responsive client-side interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can interact seamlessly with the API, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Security Measures:** Implemented input sanitization techniques to prevent malicious attacks, ensuring the security of the application.

- **Git Management:** Maintained an organized and well-documented Git repository, making use of frequent and meaningful commits. The project's codebase is efficiently managed to track changes and facilitate collaboration.

## Usage

To access the superhero data web app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `client` directory for the frontend files and the `server` directory for the backend files.
3. Ensure Node.js is installed and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `node index.js`
5. Access the web app on your local machine or deploy it to a public URL.
